<p align="center">
This project is an implementation of the shell created as a Milestone Project for the C code at ALX Africa Software Engineering. </br>
The gates of shell is a project in the first trimester, that helps student to understand the advanced
concepts behind the shell program include process, system call, bit manipulation, file managment, error handling ... </br>
Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). </br>
This program was written entirely in C Language.

 ## Description :
This is a shell written in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
It is based on [the Thompson Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_shell).

## Environment :

Our shell was built and tested on  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Features
* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors.
* Hndling the ‚Äúend of file‚Äù condition (Ctrl+D)
* Hanling the command line with arguments
* Handle the PATH
* Support the exit features and the exit status
* Handle the Ctrl-C to not terminate the shell
* Handling the command seperator `;`
* Handling `&&` and `||` logical operators
* Handle variable replacements `$?` and `$$`
* Handle the comments `#`
* Support the history feature
* Support the file input

## Builtins
* The exit builtin `exit [STATUS]`
* The change directory `cd [DIRECTORY] | [OPTION]`
* Display the environnment variables `env`
* Initialize a new environnment variables or created if not match `setenv [VARIABLE] [VALUE]`
* Remove an environnment variable `unsetenv [VARIABLE]`
* Support the aliases `alias [name [='value'] ...]`
* Display help `help [BUILTIN]`
* Display history `history`

 ## Installation : Getting HSH
 
Clone the below repository and compile the files into an executable using the GCC compiler.
```
https://github.com/StellahMbao/simple_shell.git
```

### Basic usage :bulb:
- First, [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
- Then [clone it to your local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Create an executable by running the following command:
- `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
- From there, type in the following command and press your enter button.
- `./hsh`
- Final step: ENJOY!


## Example :computer:
```
ls -la
```
